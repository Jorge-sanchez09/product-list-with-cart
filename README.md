## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/SCSS
- SCSS variables/mixins/modules
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was a good exercise for practicing many of the React concepts I've learned so far, including managing State, Reducers, Refs, Contexts and Effects.

### Continued development

So far I'm still learning the basics about React, so I'm looking forward to adding more knowledge in order to be able to use this library in a more efficient and readable way.

### Useful resources

- [React docs](https://react.dev/) - This is the main source I use for reading about React and remembering its concepts, hooks, APIs, etc.
